# ADR 0013 — The memory↔storage seam: backend selection fails loud, never demotes

> [!NOTE]
> **Status:** accepted
> **Date:** 2026-06-13

## Context

The V5 unbundling repositioned `agentm` as a *storage-agnostic* memory engine: its default backing becomes device-local plain markdown (`~/.agentm/memory/`), and the existing Drive-synced Obsidian vault becomes one backing among several, reached through an interface rather than the one filesystem layout the engine was born assuming. [ADR 0011](0011-v5-unbundling-dev-loop.md) framed that repositioning ("the memory engine is what only agentm provides"); [ADR 0012](0012-vault-write-protocol.md) hardened the *vault write path* underneath it. Neither answered the structural question this work resolves: **how does the engine reach its markdown state without hard-coding "the vault is a directory tree on this disk", and how does it choose — and refuse — a backing by name?**

V5-1 is that seam, shipped as a five-part arc (parts 1–4 build the contract + two concrete backends + a conformance suite; part 5 ships selection). The trigger is the same one behind ADR 0012 — concurrent agents, one Claude Code session per sibling repo — plus the V5 direction of a fresh install working with **zero setup** (no vault to mount, no Drive to authenticate, no database to provision). A device-local default satisfies zero-setup; a seam makes the vault swappable behind it; selection picks between them. The hazard selection introduces is the reason this is ADR-worthy: a misconfigured or uninstalled backend must **never** silently degrade to device-local, because a silent demotion is exactly what mis-writes or orphans an operator's live vault.

**Open questions this decision resolves:**

- How does the engine read and write its markdown state without baking one filesystem layout into every call?
- What does the engine hold as a handle — a real path, or something that cannot leak a filesystem assumption?
- When a configured backend can't be produced (plugin uninstalled, `vault` selected with no `vault_path`, config corrupt), does selection guess, demote, or refuse?
- Where does the "what does a registry miss *mean*" policy live — in the lookup, or in selection?

## Decision

### 1. The engine reaches storage through a small interface of verbs that hand back an opaque `Locator`, never a `Path` (DC-1)

`scripts/storage_seam.py` defines the verbs a storage layer actually needs — `resolve` / `read` / `write` / `list` / `exists` (+ `info` / `mkdir`) — and they operate on, and return, the seam's own `Locator` type, **never** a `pathlib.Path`. A `Locator` is an opaque, backend-relative key exposing only namespace operations (`child`, `name`, `parts`); all I/O goes back through the verbs. So the engine, holding only `Locator` values, learns *no* filesystem assumption — it cannot `open()` a locator, join it against a disk path, or tell whether the bytes live on this device or elsewhere. That is exactly the property that lets a backend be swapped without the engine noticing.

**Why opaque, not a `Path`:** if a verb returned a `Path`, the leak would be silent and total — downstream code would treat it as a real handle and "swap the backend, the engine doesn't notice" would quietly stop being true. The vocabulary deliberately mirrors [fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/)'s method names and named-protocol registry, a well-trodden "one interface, many filesystems" shape — but the seam imports neither fsspec nor any database. Bare markdown is the floor.

### 2. The no-`Path`-leak rule is gate-enforced, AST-based, scoped to `storage_*.py` (DC-2)

`check-storage-seam-no-path-leak.py` parses each `scripts/storage_*.py` file and inspects every seam verb's *return annotation*, flagging any path type however nested (`Path`, `list[Path]`, `Path | None`, `Optional[Path]`, `pathlib.`-qualified, `os.PathLike`). It is the structural sibling of the process seam's `check-process-seam-import-direction` gate.

**Why the return annotation specifically, not a line-grep:** a filesystem backend legitimately writes `Path` all through its body (`root / key`); a grep for "Path" would drown in false positives. Only *handing one back* is the violation, and the return annotation is precisely where that shows up. The scan is scoped to `storage_*.py` so `test_*.py` fixtures (which construct a `Path`-returning backend to test the gate itself) are out of scope. It rides `check-all.sh` as the 18th gate — see [CI gates](CI-Gates).

### 3. A registry miss is *absence* (`get → None`), not an error; selection is where absence becomes fail-loud (DC-3)

A backend is chosen by *name*: it registers into `BackendRegistry` under a protocol name (`device-local`, `vault`), and selection resolves a configured name against the registry. Resolving an unregistered name does **not** raise — `registry.get` returns `None`. Deciding what that `None` *means* is selection's job, and keeping the decision there is the point.

**Why absence is not corruption:** the seam draws this distinction everywhere. A missing file degrades to `FileNotFoundError`; only a malformed key (a `..` escape) raises `InvalidLocatorError`. The registry extends that stance to *naming* — an unregistered protocol is absent, not malformed. Folding a raise into `get` would scatter the fail-loud policy across every lookup; leaving `get` honest about absence concentrates it in one place. Registering *badly*, by contrast, is a programming bug surfaced immediately — empty/duplicate name → `ProtocolError`; a non-backend → `TypeError`.

### 4. Selection refuses loudly with `StorageSelectionError` — it never demotes to device-local (DC-4)

<!-- V5-7 all 3 tasks shipped: task 1 — vault_path() reads plugins.obsidian-vault.vault_path first; task 2 — --vault-path writes the plugin-namespaced key + storage.backend=vault; task 3 — choose_protocol lost its vault_root parameter; the implicit "else an existing vault_path" rule is removed. V5-8 (31f1ba9): env-var step retained; resolution chain is 3-step: explicit storage.backend → $MEMORY_VAULT_PATH env var → device-local. -->
The selection resolver (`scripts/backend_selection.py`) maps the on-device install config to a concrete, registered backend via the 3-step chain: (1) an explicit `storage.backend` config value wins; (2) `$MEMORY_VAULT_PATH` env var set (non-empty) → `vault` (explicit env-based escape hatch); (3) else `device-local`. **V5-7 task 3 (shipped):** the implicit rule that would select `vault` when an existing `vault_path` was detected without `storage.backend` has been removed; `choose_protocol` no longer accepts a `vault_root` parameter. `--vault-path` writes `storage.backend=vault` automatically. When the configured backend **can't be produced**, selection raises `StorageSelectionError` and **never** falls back silently. Three refusal cases:

- The named backend's plugin is **uninstalled** (`registry.get → None`, the part-1 resolve-as-absent signal) → raise, with a message naming the missing backend and the currently-registered alternatives.
- `vault` is selected but there is **no `vault_path`** to seed it → raise (a configuration error, surfaced not guessed).
- The install config exists but is **corrupt/unreadable**, or `storage.backend` is present-but-not-a-non-empty-string → raise. The resolver deliberately does **not** reuse `agentm_config._read_config`, whose tolerant contract collapses "file missing" and "file present but unreadable" into the same `None` — that collapse is itself a silent-demotion hole, so `_configured_backend` distinguishes the cases by hand.

**Why never demote:** a silent fall-back to `device-local` is the single failure that mis-writes or orphans the vault — an operator with a configured-but-uninstalled `vault` plugin would have the engine quietly start a fresh empty device-local store while their real memory sits untouched and ignored. A loud refusal forces the operator to fix the install (or change the config), which is always the correct outcome for a misconfiguration. This is the symmetric reflex to ADR 0012's "surface, never auto-merge" janitor and the seam's "reject a `..` key" rule: the failure that would otherwise hide is made loud at the moment it happens.

### 5. The `doctor` storage preview shares the resolver's code path so it can never drift from the runtime guard (DC-5)

`doctor`'s storage check invokes `backend_selection.storage_preview()` — a read-only, never-raising snapshot mapping the resolution to an `[OK]` / `[WARN]` / `[FAIL]` row. It reuses the resolver's own `_install_plugin_message` and resolution chain rather than reimplementing them, so the preview an operator sees in `doctor` is byte-identical to what the guard raises at runtime. Same idiom as the `check-worktree-slug` probe sharing the slug-resolution code.

### 6. V5-1 ships selection + refusal only — **not** the engine cutover (DC-6)

After part 5, selection can *resolve which* backend a config would use and refuse a misconfiguration — but the live `recall` / `reflect` / `save` / `evolve` and the five memory hooks are **byte-unchanged** and still access state the old way. Pointing the engine's public API at the selected backend (the **engine cutover**) is a separate, later step beyond V5-1; the derived index lands in V6.

**Why defer the cutover:** the selection-and-refusal contract is proven on its own — in tests, in `doctor` — before the live read/write path moves. Decoupling "decide and refuse" from "actually route" keeps each diff reviewable and makes the eventual cutover an expand→contract, never a flag day. It also means this ADR's fail-loud guarantee is in `main` and observable (via `doctor`) well before it gates real writes.

## Consequences

**Positive**

- **A misconfigured backend can never silently corrupt or orphan the vault.** The worst outcome is a loud, actionable refusal naming the missing plugin and the installed alternatives — never a quiet fresh-empty-store demotion.
- **The engine holds no filesystem assumption**, so the backend is swappable by name with the engine none the wiser — the seam's entire reason to exist, made structural by the opaque `Locator` and the AST gate.
- **One policy, one place.** "What a registry miss means" lives only in selection; the registry stays honest about absence and every lookup site inherits the same fail-loud without re-stating it.
- **The guard and its preview cannot drift.** `doctor`'s preview and the runtime refusal share a code path, so an operator's pre-flight check is exactly the runtime behavior.

**Negative**

- **A loud refusal is a hard stop, not a graceful degrade.** An operator whose `vault` plugin is uninstalled gets an error rather than a running (if wrong) engine. This is the intended trade — for memory state, a wrong-but-running engine is worse than a stopped one — but it means backend config errors block startup until fixed.
- **The fail-loud guard mostly sleeps until V5-3.** Until the built-in `vault` backend is removed (V5-3), both built-ins register at import, so `registry.get → None` only fires for a genuinely-unregistered third-party name. The guard is correct and tested now, but its primary blast radius (a configured-but-uninstalled `vault`) arrives later. ***[Resolved in V5-3 / ADR 0018]:** the guard is now load-bearing — `vault_path()` raises `StorageBackendNotInstalledError` when `storage.backend=vault` is configured + no vault accessible.*
- **The engine cutover is still pending**, so the seam's swap-the-backend property is proven but not yet *exercised* by the live engine. Selection resolving a backend is not the same as the engine using it. ***[Resolved in V5-3 / ADR 0018]:** `harness_state_dir`, `read_state_file`, `write_state_file`, `phase_recall`, and `resolve_documenter_context` now all use device-local paths exclusively; the kernel no longer routes state through the vault.*

**Load-bearing assumptions (with re-audit triggers)**

- **Text is the v1 currency** (`read → str`, `write` takes `str`) because the engine's state is markdown. **Re-audit trigger:** a backend needs a bytes or binary channel — then widen the verb contract deliberately, never reach past it.
- **`mtime` is the incremental-feed granularity** (`Info.mtime`, the future `changed_since`), chosen lean over a content-hash log. **Re-audit trigger:** the V6 index needs change-detection finer than mtime survives on a synced backend — then add a hash log as a separate tier concern.
- **The local index never syncs** (the three-tier `source` / `shared-abstracts` / `local-index` taxonomy, reserved before the index exists). **Re-audit trigger:** the V6 index lands and the tier roots must stay distinct — the `TierLayout` guard already enforces this structurally; revisit only if a derived tier ever needs to live on its source.
- **A wrong-but-running memory engine is worse than a stopped one**, which is the whole justification for fail-loud over graceful-degrade. **Re-audit trigger:** a deployment appears where memory is genuinely optional and a missing backend should degrade rather than block — then the refusal would need a config-gated soft mode (it has none today, by design).
- **Scaffolding decays with the model.** **Re-audit trigger:** the underlying model ships a new major version — re-audit the whole seam (the operator's standing harness-maintenance principle).

## Amendment — 2026-06-18 (V5-7): capability-request matching extends DC-4 with the same fail-loud principle

**V5-7 adds `CapabilityMismatchError` and the `required=` parameter to `select_backend`.** A caller may now declare what capabilities it needs by passing `required: Capabilities | None = None`; when the selected backend does not satisfy every `True` requirement, `select_backend` raises `CapabilityMismatchError` (a `StorageSelectionError` subclass). `required=None` (the default) preserves all prior behavior — zero caller changes needed on existing call sites.

**The key non-obvious decision: subset-only matching — a mismatch is always an error, never a silent downgrade or reroute.**

Alternatives considered:

- *Silent downgrade:* if the selected backend fails the requirement, pick the next-registered backend that satisfies it. Rejected — this is the same silent-demotion hazard DC-4 already forbids: a caller that asked for `concurrent_writers=True` and gets `device-local` silently has a worse problem than a loud stop.
- *Return a warning:* yield the mismatched backend and surface a warning string. Rejected — a caller that declared a capability *requirement* gets what it asked for or gets a stop; "here's the backend but it can't do what you asked" is incoherent.
- *Partial satisfaction:* raise only when *no* requirement is met; allow a backend that satisfies *some* but not all requirements. Rejected — partial satisfaction is indistinguishable from silent demotion on the unsatisfied capabilities.

The rationale is the same load-bearing assumption DC-4 carries: a wrong-but-running engine (with unmet capability requirements) is worse than a stopped one. The re-audit trigger is likewise the same: if a deployment genuinely needs partial-satisfaction or graceful-degrade semantics, add a config-gated soft mode rather than softening the default.

**V5-7 also adds `--requires <CAPS>` to `_doctor_main`** — the operator-facing surface of `required=`. It validates capability names (unknown name → stderr + exit 1 before any backend is constructed), calls `select_backend(required=...)`, and prints `PASS`/`FAIL` with exit 0/1. This extends DC-5's "preview and runtime share a code path" principle: the `--requires` flag is the pre-flight surface for the `required=` guard, byte-identical in its output.

**Constructor:** `CapabilityMismatchError(protocol: str, unsatisfied: list[str])`. `str(e)` → `"backend '<protocol>' does not satisfy required capabilities: <field1>, <field2>"`. Exposed in `backend_selection.__all__` alongside `StorageSelectionError`. Proven by `TestCapabilityMatching` (8 cases) + `TestDoctorRequires` (5 cases) in [`scripts/test_backend_selection.py`](https://github.com/alexherrero/agentm/blob/main/scripts/test_backend_selection.py).
