# Device-wide architecture for the Agent M harness

> [!NOTE]
> **Status:** initial publication (v0.1) — 2026-05-26. Paired with plan #18 close.
> **Position in arc:** companion to [`agent-memory-evolution.md`](agent-memory-evolution.md). That doc covers the V1 → V8 evolution of Agent Memory; this doc covers the V4 architectural shift — from per-repo harness to **device-wide agentic OS**.
> **Lifecycle:** updated on every qualifying release per the operator's HLD-update convention. See **Lifecycle** at the bottom.

## Goals

Agent M started as a phase-gated workflow for a single repo. It outgrew that frame. The harness is now a device-wide agentic development environment + learning assistant — installed once per machine, present in every conversation by default, with state living in the operator's vault rather than scattered across project directories.

This design locks the V4 shape:

1. Customizations install device-wide to `~/.claude/` (skills, sub-agents, hooks, slash commands). One install per machine; available in every project.
2. Harness state moves from `<project>/.harness/` to `<vault>/projects/<slug>/_harness/`. Repos stay clean — no gitignored harness clutter; multi-device access via Obsidian sync.
3. Project resolution defaults to cwd → vault slug, with a future-ready resolver chain so V6/V7 can add non-coding anchors (house projects, vacation planning, research) without breaking V4 code.
4. First conversation in a new project auto-detects what the project is + proposes a configuration. No separate `setup-project.sh` script.
5. Vault is canonical for context, state, drafts; only final published outputs leave the vault.
6. The vault holds context for **any subject the operator cares about** — not just projects. Cross-cutting content (people, conversations, ad-hoc captures, web snippets, correspondence) gets a first-class home alongside `projects/`. V4 sets the device-wide foundation + vault-as-canonical-context principle; V6 builds the explicit content shapes (project type taxonomy + non-project content layers).

Build work for #1–#5 falls out into V4 #26 (vault-backed state), V4 #30 (global-install + first-run vault detection), V4 #32 (auto-detect + auto-configure), V4 #35 (documenter vault-context resolution), and V4 #36 (agentm/crickets reorganization) — all sequenced after this design pass (V4 #31) locks. Goal #6 lands in V6 (non-project content shapes + project type taxonomy together).

## Background

The V3 model had a clear shape: per-project install via `bash install.sh <target>` drops files into `<project>/.claude/`; the harness keeps a gitignored `.harness/` next to your code; state moves with the repo. That works for one developer with one project. It strains everywhere else:

- **Cross-project queries** (*"what did I ship last Tuesday across all my projects?"*) require opening each project individually.
- **Cross-device continuity** doesn't exist — your phone can read the vault but not the per-project `.harness/PLAN.md`.
- **Onboarding new repos** means re-running `install.sh` for every project; easy to forget.
- **Repo clutter** — every project has `.harness/`, `.claude/`, and (post-Antigravity-2.0) `.agents/` directories cluttering the project root.
- **The agent's tools are scattered** — your skills + hooks + commands belong to YOU, not to each project. Today's per-project install model says otherwise.

V4 reframes the harness as the operator's agentic OS — installed device-wide, with project-specific state living in the vault. Each repo on disk stays minimal: source code + AGENTS.md + CLAUDE.md + optional `.project-slug` override file. Everything else is device-wide or vault-backed.

The architectural principle that makes this work is **vault-as-canonical-context** — the vault holds everything the agent needs; only final published outputs leave.

## Architectural Principles

### Vault-as-canonical-context

> [!NOTE]
> **Amended 2026-06-03 (V5 — the unbundling).** This principle is **generalized, not retired.** The memory engine becomes *storage-agnostic*: its default backing is **device-local** (`~/.agentm/memory/`); the Obsidian vault becomes a *backing plugin* (`obsidian-vault`). For the operator the vault stays canonical — they install that plugin, and the existing vault is conserved through a live expand→parallel-run→contract cutover, never a flag day. The general form is **"your *configured* storage backing is canonical."** The `[[vault-as-canonical-context]]` always-load convention is amended in lockstep. Full architecture: [`memory-os-architecture.md`](memory-os-architecture.md). *(Arc note: V5 now denotes this shift; the former V5 (indexed retrieval) → V6 and former V6 (dreaming) → V7. References below that predate this entry use the old numbering, pending the renumber sweep.)*

Per [[vault-as-canonical-context]] (an always-load convention as of 2026-05-26):

The Agent Memory vault is the canonical home for all context, state, drafts, knowledge, and working artifacts. Outputs leave the vault only for final published consumption — repository READMEs, wiki published pages, GitHub release notes, source code in repos. The act of publishing is **promote from vault → repo**, not "create directly in repo." The vault retains the context + a copy/reference of its outputs for later retrieval.

This principle drives the rest of the architecture:

- State migration (V4 #26) moves harness state INTO the vault because state is context the agent needs.
- Documenter vault-context resolution (V4 #35) reads context from the vault when generating outputs.
- V6 indexed retrieval relies on EVERYTHING being in one canonical place — without that, no useful index.
- V7 dreaming consolidates over the vault contents; same prerequisite.

### Operator-in-the-loop preserved

Device-wide ≠ autonomous. The A3 permeable boundary — operator confirms vault writes that affect personal content — stays. Auto-detect on first session **proposes**; operator approves or edits. Dreaming proposes consolidations; operator gates each. Cross-device sync surfaces conflicts to the operator; no silent overwrites.

### Markdown-canonical + filesystem-only

State in vault is markdown files in directories. No database (V6 adds an index ON TOP of markdown, never replacing it). The vault stays human-readable, scriptable, GDrive-syncable, Obsidian-browsable.

### Per-cwd runtime ephemeral stays per-cwd

A small carve-out: `.evidence-reads` (the evidence-tracker hook's session-state cache) stays at `<project>/.harness/.evidence-reads` even post-V4 #26. It's per-session runtime cache, regenerated each session; vault-syncing it would create write storms via GDrive. Everything else moves.

## Architecture

The target layout — what lives where after V4 builds land:

(optional operator-private sibling repo — adds shell-env wiring if present;
 agentm install is self-sufficient otherwise. See ADR 0012 § 6 for the
 invisibility policy.)
```

The repo on disk is intentionally minimal. Repo-side `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` continue to carry project-specific agent instructions. The optional `.project-slug` file is a per-repo override for vault-slug resolution; usually not needed since AGENTS.md frontmatter or cwd-basename inference handles it.

## Project resolution

Per design call #7 + the resolver-chain abstraction in task 4 prep:

`resolve_project(context) → Optional[Resolution]` returns `{slug, type, vault_path}`. v1 uses only `cwd`; future versions add Obsidian-file-anchored, conversation-anchored, and explicit-operator-selected resolvers without breaking the v1 contract.

**v1 resolution chain (fallback order):**

1. `explicit_slug` — caller provides it; always-available override.
2. `AGENTS.md` frontmatter `vault_slug:` field — preferred declared override (AGENTS.md is already a checked-in convention file).
3. `.project-slug` plain-text file — fallback for projects that don't use AGENTS.md.
4. Legacy `<project>/.harness/project.json` `vault_project` field — preserved for transition.
5. cwd basename inference against `<vault>/projects/<slug>/_index.md`.
6. `git remote get-url origin` → basename → same vault lookup.
7. `None` — no signal. Callers either graceful-skip OR trigger auto-detect bootstrap (V4 #32).

**v1 always returns `type: "coding"`.** V6 reads `type:` from `_index.md` frontmatter and supports `build | vacation | research | ...` per the project type taxonomy (a V6 ROADMAP item).

When resolution returns `None`, the agent in a session triggers auto-detect bootstrap (next section). When it succeeds, every downstream skill/hook/command gets a stable `{slug, type, vault_path}` to operate against.

## State migration

`<project>/.harness/<file>` → `<vault>/projects/<slug>/_harness/<file>`.

Coupled with a one-time vault folder rename: `<vault>/personal-projects/` → `<vault>/projects/` (operator preference 2026-05-26 — shorter; extensible naming for future project types).

**Order of operations in V4 #26 build:**

1. Vault folder rename FIRST (so state lands at the new path; no intermediate). Single `mv` + sed sweep across scripts + always-load entries + wikilinks. Operator runs once.
2. State migration per project: `bash agentm/scripts/migrate-harness-to-vault.sh <target-project>` walks each `<target>/.harness/<file>` and writes to `<vault>/projects/<slug>/_harness/<file>`. Idempotent.
3. Phase specs + dispatcher scripts updated to read/write vault paths.
4. Backward-compat: dispatchers check `.harness/<file>` as graceful fallback during transition (with deprecation warning).

**The `_harness/` naming locks** — matches vault prefix-underscore convention (`_always-load/`, `_meta/`, `_idea-incubator/`). Self-documenting: anyone scanning a project dir sees `_harness/` = harness-managed state.

**Hard-cut at agentm v4.0.0** — legacy `<project>/.harness/` reads removed entirely. v3.x MINOR releases warn; v3.9.x ships a strong banner; v4.0.0 removes the fallback.

## Dispatcher contracts

Per task 6 prep: every customization now has TWO lookup types.

**State lookup** — for customizations reading/writing PLAN.md / progress.md / FOLLOWUPS.md / features.json / etc. Uses `vault_state_path(resolution, "PLAN.md")` → `<vault>/projects/<slug>/_harness/PLAN.md`.

**Context lookup** — for doc-touching customizations (writing READMEs, wiki, ADRs, CHANGELOG, designs). Uses `vault_context(resolution, writing_target="adr")` returning a dict of project entries (decisions, conventions) + operator-personal entries (`docs-prose-style`, `silent-source-influences`, `adr-shape`, etc.) relevant to that writing target.

A small table maps `writing_target` → relevant always-load entries:

| Target | Always-load entries pulled |
|---|---|
| `adr` | adr-shape, docs-prose-style, silent-source-influences |
| `wiki-page` | docs-prose-style, docs-cover-ours-link-theirs, wiki-url-not-file-path-for-readme-crossrefs |
| `readme` | docs-prose-style, personal-comms-style, brand-consistency-end-to-end-cascade |
| `changelog` | changelog-shape, coordinated-release-order, hld-evolution-update-on-major-release |
| `design` (HLD) | adr-shape, vault-as-canonical-context, no-internal-google-refs-in-design-docs |
| `commit-message` | commit-no-coauthor-trailer |

V4 #35 ships the helper. Doc-touching customizations call it before generating output. Operator-personal entries **influence** the output (style, voice, constraints) but don't appear literally in the published doc.

## Installer redesign + first-run vault detection + auto-detect bootstrap

### `bash install.sh --scope user` — new default

Installs device-wide. Detects the operator-private shell-env sibling repo if present; defers to it; otherwise writes directly to `~/.zshrc` (or detected shell config). Cross-platform parity with `install.ps1`.

Agentm install **bundles crickets** automatically (per operator decision: agentm depends on crickets, crickets is independent). Discovery is via one-liner:

```bash
# agentm one-liner — installs both agentm + crickets
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexherrero/agentm/main/install.sh | bash

# crickets standalone one-liner
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexherrero/crickets/main/install.sh | bash
```

Pre-pipe notes in each repo's README make the asymmetric dependency clear without requiring the operator's optional shell-env sibling.

### `bash install.sh --scope project <target>` — retained as opt-in

For OSS contributors, testing, or per-project install needs. Minor warning at install that `--scope user` is now recommended.

### First-run vault detection

When `MEMORY_VAULT_PATH` is unset OR points at a non-existent path, the installer (or a SessionStart hook on first session post-install) probes common paths in order:

1. `$MEMORY_VAULT_PATH` env (if set).
2. `~/.config/crickets/memory.yml` `vault_path:` key.
3. Mac: `~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-*/My Drive/Obsidian/AgentMemory/`, `~/Library/CloudStorage/iCloudDrive*/Obsidian/AgentMemory/`.
4. Cross-platform: `~/Obsidian/AgentMemory/`, `~/Documents/Obsidian/AgentMemory/`, `~/AgentMemory/`.

If found, propose to operator. If not found, prompt: *"Where's your vault? Or do you not have one yet?"* If no vault, suggest a recommended path + link to `Set-Up-AgentMemory-Vault.md`. Operator can also defer with graceful-skip mode (memory-coupled features dormant until vault is configured later).

Full iCloud Drive sync semantics (conflict-file naming, offline behavior) finalize in V7; v1 stubs detection.

### Auto-detect bootstrap on first session in unconfigured project

Replaces a separate `setup-project.sh` script (per operator decision: no separate setup script).

Flow on SessionStart:

1. Hook runs `resolve_project({cwd})`. If resolution succeeds (project registered), exit silently.
2. If `None`, run auto-detect: scan cwd for project signals (wiki/, CHANGELOG.md, .env files, tests/, etc.).
3. Propose to operator: *"This looks like a new project I haven't seen. Detected: [list]. Default: register with all skills + hooks enabled. (a) all-enabled (b) custom selection (c) skip (one-time scratch session)."*
4. On approve: write `<vault>/projects/<slug>/_index.md` + `_harness/features.json` + offer to add `vault_slug:` line to AGENTS.md.
5. Subsequent sessions resolve via the new registration.

**Default-all-enabled** per operator preference. Detection rules surface RATIONALE for why each skill is on; operator opts out per skill if desired.

10 initial detection rules ship: `R-wiki` (enables diataxis-author), `R-changelog`+`R-pkg-manifest` (enables ship-release), `R-dependabot` (enables dependabot-fixer), `R-pii` (enables pii-scrubber), `R-tests` (ensures evidence-tracker), `R-harness` (bypass), `R-pkg-scripts` (informs kill-switch + steer), `R-vault-content` (memory-* hooks), `R-design` (enables design skill), `R-non-coding` (V6 type-aware enablement).

Detection rules extensible — operator can drop custom rules at `~/.config/agentm/detection-rules.d/<name>.py`.

## agentm/crickets reorganization (V4 #36)

The harness has evolved into the operator's agentic environment. Compound skills and agentic memory belong canonically in agentm; crickets keeps base/primitive customizations.

**Classification rubric:**

- **Base/primitive** (stays in crickets) — atomic in purpose; universally useful across coding projects regardless of harness use; self-contained.
- **Compound** (moves to agentm) — multi-step workflow; tightly coupled to harness flow or vault.

**Move list — to agentm post-V4 #36:**

- Skills: `memory`, `design`, `diataxis-author`, `ship-release`.
- Sub-agents: `memory-idea-researcher`.
- Hooks: `memory-recall-session-start`, `memory-recall-prompt-submit`, `memory-reflect-idle`, `memory-reflect-stop`, `evidence-tracker`.
- Plugins layer: `plugins/example-plugin/` + `scripts/install-plugin.sh`.

**Stays in crickets — base primitives:**

- Skills: `pii-scrubber`, `dependabot-fixer`.
- Sub-agents: `evaluator`, `adapt-evaluator`, `diataxis-evaluator`.
- Hooks: `kill-switch`, `steer`, `commit-on-stop`.
- Schema: `Manifest-Schema.md` + `validate-manifests.py` — the contract for ALL kinds; validator invocable against any repo's manifests.

**Removed entirely:**

- `bundles/quality-gates/` — dissolved. Operator gets the 5 customizations (evaluator + 3 base hooks + evidence-tracker) via `--all` default install or individual flags. A new how-to page `Quality-Gates-Recipe.md` documents the recipe.
- `bundles/example-bundle/` — removed.
- `kind: bundle` stays in schema as reserved-future (no bundles ship).
- ADR 0010 (quality-gates bundle) — deleted entirely (no supersession marker; clean removal).

**Release shape:** paired pair #11 — crickets v2.0.0 (MAJOR; primitives-removed = breaking) + agentm v4.0.0 (MAJOR; compound-skills-added + hard-cut deprecation).

## Concurrency + multi-device sync

The vault syncs across devices via Obsidian + GDrive. Two sessions on different devices may write the same project's state concurrently.

> [!NOTE]
> **Amended 2026-06-12 (V5-0 — the vault-write protocol).** The concrete write mechanics below were the V4 #26 design; V5-0 ("R4 Phase-0") shipped a canonical protocol that **strengthens** them, locked in [ADR 0012 — The vault-write protocol](memory-storage-seam) (operator reference: [Vault write protocol](../reference/Vault-Write-Protocol.md)). Three changes supersede the wording in this section: (1) replace-style writes now compare-and-swap on a **content hash**, not last-modified — Drive re-downloads rewrite mtimes, so the mtime check is kept working-but-deprecated and the sha256 CAS is preferred (`safe_write_replace_style(..., expected_hash=…)`, [`scripts/harness_memory.py:626`](https://github.com/alexherrero/agentm/blob/main/scripts/harness_memory.py#L626)); (2) shared-vault writes now serialize on a **real, enforced per-vault mutex** — a `mkdir`/`O_EXCL` lockdir *outside* the synced vault, with an mtime heartbeat and stale-takeover ([`scripts/vault_lock.py`](https://github.com/alexherrero/agentm/blob/main/scripts/vault_lock.py)) — superseding the "advisory `.session-lock`, informational, not enforced" line; (3) the conflict sweep broadened from the single `(conflicted copy …)` substring to **four Drive marker families** plus the DriveFS `lost_and_found/` dump. The file-class taxonomy below still holds; only its enforcement strength changed.

**File classes by write pattern:**

- **Append-only** (progress.md, _inbox/, archives) — natural merge via timestamps. GDrive sync handles concurrent appends. A SessionStart hook scans for conflict-named files + surfaces resolution UX (V5-0 broadened the scan to four marker families — `(conflicted copy …)`, `[Conflict]`, `Copy of …`, `… (N).ext` numbered duplicates — plus the DriveFS `lost_and_found/` dump).
- **Replace-style** (PLAN.md, _index.md, features.json) — content-hash compare-and-swap pre-write check (V5-0; mtime kept deprecated). If the content changed between read + write, the writer raises `ConcurrentModificationError` and the caller re-reads + retries.
- **Cursor-tracked** (`.promoted-progress-cursor`) — existing V4 #8 primitive, generalized for ROADMAP + FOLLOWUPS promotion. Repo-local; takes the atomic writer but no mutex (partitioned by construction).
- **Per-cwd runtime** (`.evidence-reads`) — stays in `<project>/.harness/`; not synced; per-cwd cache.
- **Shared-vault mutex** (V5-0) — every shared-vault write (replace-style state, the repo registry, `/memory save` / `/memory evolve`) acquires the one per-vault lockdir before its atomic write. Enforced, local-only by design (cross-device exclusion is impossible on Drive). Supersedes the earlier advisory `.session-lock` framing.

Multi-device concurrent operation is supported with graceful degradation. Hard-merge conflicts surface to operator with clear UX paths.

## Migration plan

Single entry point: `bash agentm/install.sh --scope user --migrate-existing`. Steps:

1. Install agentm + crickets device-wide (clones crickets if absent).
2. Detect vault (or run first-run vault detection if absent).
3. Per registered project in vault: run `migrate-harness-to-vault.sh` (moves `.harness/<files>` to `<vault>/projects/<slug>/_harness/`).
4. Per repo NOT yet in vault but with `.harness/` populated: prompt auto-detect bootstrap.
5. Print summary.

Idempotent. Tracks completion via `<vault>/projects/<slug>/_harness/.migrated-from-v3` marker.

Backward-compat: dispatchers check both vault + legacy paths during transition (writes vault-only; reads check both with deprecation warning). v4.0.0 hard-cut removes legacy fallback.

## Cross-impacts

This design unlocks the rest of the V4 line:

- **V4 #36** ships first (reorg) so subsequent builds reference the new repo boundaries.
- **V4 #26** ships state migration + folder rename.
- **V4 #30** ships global install + first-run vault detection + one-liner installers.
- **V4 #35** ships documenter vault-context resolution.
- **V4 #32** auto-detect builds on #30 (skills available device-wide) + #35 (documenter generates propose-config text).
- **V4 #33** (cleanup) + **V4 #34** (operator aesthetic pass) follow once foundations are solid.
- **V4 #25** audit reframes as post-build — audits external sources against the new model, not the per-repo predecessor.
- **V4 #28** (FRIDAY-style) gets its full payoff after V6 retrieval + V7 multi-surface land.

V6 prepares for indexed retrieval — vault-as-canonical-context (this design's principle) is what makes V6 work. V7 prepares for dreaming + multi-surface — same dependency chain.

**Non-project vault content (V6 item).** Project content lives in `<vault>/projects/<slug>/` per V4. Non-project content — people, conversations, web-clips, email correspondence, ad-hoc captures — lands in `<vault>/personal-private/` under sub-folders to be designed in a new V6 ROADMAP item (*Non-project vault content shapes*). The V4 architecture supports this without modification: vault-as-canonical-context covers ALL content; the V6 retrieval index works over the whole vault, not just projects; V7 dreaming consolidates across everything; V7 multi-surface enables ingestion via web-hosted agents (send a snippet from a browser → vault inbox → agent triages). V4 builds the foundation; V6 builds the explicit content shapes (project type taxonomy + non-project layers); V7 enables cross-surface access + ingestion.

## Open questions

Tracked in [`agentm/.harness/designs/v4-device-wide/12-open-questions.md`](https://github.com/alexherrero/agentm/blob/main/.harness/designs/v4-device-wide/12-open-questions.md) (operator-local). Each question has an explicit deferral target — V4 build plan, V6 plan time, V7 plan time, or operator preference. The list is not load-bearing for this HLD; build plans inherit it.

## Lifecycle

Per the operator's [[hld-evolution-update-on-major-release]] convention, this HLD gets a new dated subsection added whenever a release introduces, changes, or locks a relevant design call.

**Update history:**

- **v1.0 — 2026-06-18 — V5-6 — Routing-plane de-vaulting: `resolve_project` / `_vault_projects_dir`, `repo_registry`, and `state_mode` route through the storage seam.** The third and final leg of the V5 de-vaulting arc (data plane V5-3 ✅, config plane V5-7 partial ✅, routing plane V5-6 ✅). After this release a fresh install with only the `device-local` backend can host a project, harness state, and the repo registry without needing a vault. On the `obsidian-vault` backend every mechanism resolves to identical bytes in identical locations — behavior-preserving by parallel-run proof (LC-1 / LC-7). `state_mode: vault` aliases to `state_mode: backend` at read time; no operator migration (LC-5). Gate extensions: `check-storage-seam-no-path-leak.py` Pass 2 and `check-process-seam-import-direction.sh` LC-8 block cover the routing layer; `storage_conformance.py` routing layer parameterized across both backends. Full design: [Seam-De-Vaulting-V5-6](../explanation/Seam-De-Vaulting-V5-6); reference: [Storage-Seam § Routing layer](../reference/Storage-Seam#routing-layer-v5-6); decision: [ADR 0019](memory-storage-seam). Commits: `b762987` (task 1 — resolve_project), `3af7fa6` (task 2 — repo_registry), `b62e378` (task 3 — state_mode alias), `51b1a32` (task 4 — gate extensions + conformance).

- **v0.9 — 2026-06-18 — V5-3 — agentm v5.5.0 (single-repo) — Storage cutover: delete vault backend from kernel, device-local is canonical.** Closes the engine-cutover deferral that ADR 0013 DC-6 named as "a separate, later step beyond V5-1." Three coordinated changes ship in this release. **(1) Delete built-in vault backend from kernel** (`harness_state_dir`, `read_state_file`, `write_state_file` always device-local; `phase_recall` always returns `""`; `resolve_documenter_context` always returns `None`; the one-warn-per-session-per-file deprecation path is deleted). **(2) Make vault_path() fail-loud guard load-bearing** (new `StorageBackendNotInstalledError`; `vault_path()` raises when `storage.backend=vault` is configured + no vault accessible — guard fires on the config-file branch only; `$MEMORY_VAULT_PATH` env override remains graceful-skip per DC-5). **(3) `personal-private/` → `personal/` group rename** in lockstep: vault on-disk, `_ALWAYS_LOAD_REL` kernel constant, all functional path refs in kernel + scripts tree — closes ADR 0010's first re-audit trigger. This HLD's vault-as-canonical-context principle was amended in v0.8 to mean "your *configured* backing is canonical"; V5-3 is the kernel-side completion of that: the kernel reads only device-local state; the Obsidian vault is now a plugin concern. Commits: `8cb2b48`, `05e63d3`, `053217b`. Full design rationale: [ADR 0018](memory-storage-seam).

- **v0.8 — 2026-06-03 — V5 — the unbundling (agentm as Memory OS + plugin host).** Opens the V5 arc shift (design pass; no release tagged yet). agentm is repositioned as a **storage-agnostic memory engine + plugin host**; the engineering workflow, documentation, project-management, and storage backings unbundle into crickets native plugins that agentm dogfoods to develop itself. **Amends this HLD's vault-as-canonical-context principle** (see the §Vault-as-canonical-context NOTE): memory becomes storage-agnostic with a **device-local default** (`~/.agentm/memory/`); the Obsidian vault becomes a backing plugin (`obsidian-vault`); the operator's vault is conserved via an expand→parallel-run→contract cutover, never a flag day. Introduces a **second seam** (`memory↔storage`) alongside `memory↔process`. **Arc renumber (applied)**: former V5 (indexed) → **V6**, V6 (dreaming) → **V7**, V7 (collective memory) → **V8**; new **V5** = this shift. The arc HLD, this doc's body, and the `ROADMAP-AgentMemory*` files are renumbered; the GitHub Project (projects/2) version issues renumber alongside. Full architecture: the new companion HLD [`memory-os-architecture.md`](memory-os-architecture.md).

- **v0.7 — 2026-05-28 — V4.7 — agentm v4.6.0 (single-repo) — Documenter vault-context resolution (V4 #35).** The documenter-side closure of V4 #26's state migration (this HLD's "State migration" section): with project state at `<vault>/projects/<slug>/`, the doc-touching customizations now read conventions + decisions from the vault instead of re-deriving. `harness_memory.py` gains a `documenter` recall pseudo-phase + `resolve_documenter_context(slug)` + a `documenter-context` CLI (rc `0`/`1`/`2`; `--format text|json`); the `documenter` sub-agent, `wiki-author` skill, and `diataxis-author` skill consume the bundle (pre-flight / preview-surface / convention-read respectively), graceful-skipping on vault-unreachable per the soft-dependency contract. Single-repo agentm v4.6.0 MINOR; crickets stays at v2.1.0 (HLD touchpoint only). **Dogfood + two fixes**: the documenter authored ADR 0007's Amendment 2026-05-28 via the resolver; the run surfaced a bug in this HLD's **"First-run vault detection"** design — the v4.5.1 probe matched the `.obsidian` marker at the parent Obsidian app-vault rather than the nested `AgentMemory/` MemoryVault (which carries the `_meta/repos.json` marker), splitting harness state across two roots. Fixed: `vault_path` corrected + state reconciled, plus a **v4.5.2-folded probe bugfix** (`scripts/vault_probe.py` rank+refine — prefer `_meta/repos.json` over `.obsidian`, and descend one level into a nested vault) so first-run detection now resolves a subfolder-nested vault correctly. Also tuned the documenter recall budget (4k→10k + `project_first` ordering so project decisions survive truncation). Commits: `da63046`, `fbb5b89`, `6090fc4`, `2dccf31`, `158e02b`+`2aac617`.

- **v0.6 — 2026-05-27 — V4.6 — agentm v4.5.0 (single-repo) — Migration tooling + opt-out documentation (V4 #30 plan 3 of 3 — CLOSING).** Closes the V4 #30 trio: plan 1 (v0.4 entry, paired pair #12) shipped `--scope user` install + `repo_registry` + auto-stay-in-sync; plan 2 (v0.5 entry, single-repo) shipped wiki I/O foundation; plan 3 (this entry) ships the automated + reversible migration tooling for non-operator users + opt-out documentation. Single-repo agentm v4.5.0 MINOR; crickets stays at v2.1.0 (lib/install propagates byte-identical via `sync-lib.sh` but no crickets release this plan). **`install_migrate.py` primitive** at `lib/install/python/` (~530 LOC stdlib-only): 4 classifications via SHA256 source-clone detection (safe_to_migrate / already_symlinked / operator_edited / unrecognized); `inverse_mapping_for_clones()` inverts `install_symlinks.symlink_targets_for_clone` (refactored from private `_symlink_targets_for_clone` to public — single source of truth for forward + inverse mapping; two directions can never drift). Dir-bundle SHA via sorted `(rel_path, file_sha256)` line concatenation with **dotfile-skip policy** (mandatory for macOS — Finder `.DS_Store` would otherwise leak into bundle hash + force every macOS user into false operator_edited). `.agentm-migrate-record.json` schema v1 at `<target>/` (NOT under `.claude/` — survives cleanup); three action kinds (safe_to_migrate / force_migrated with backup_path / operator_edited_skipped with optional backup_collision flag); atomic JSON write tmp+replace; merge-on-rerun keyed by `(rel_path, kind)` tuple. **`migrate-to-user-scope.{sh,ps1}` operator CLI** (~265 LOC bash + ~280 LOC pwsh twin): preview-by-default; full flag surface (`--apply` / `--rollback` / `--cleanup` mutually exclusive, `--force`, `--no-register`, `--registry-slug`, `--agentm` / `--crickets` overrides, `--yes`, `--ci-override`); apply chain dispatches install_migrate → `bash install.sh --scope user` (idempotent ~/.claude/ populate) → `repo_registry register <slug>` (default-on; --no-register opt-out per locked DC-3). **CI guard**: refuses on `$CI=true` env unless `--ci-override` passed (CI runners use per-project by design per locked DC-10). **4-state detection** inside both CLI scripts (no-claude / pre-v4.3 / explicit-project / already-user); state 1+4 early-exit bypassed for --rollback or --cleanup. **`/tmp/fake-home` fixture mid-build smoke** at `scripts/test_migrate_fixture.sh` — 8-step lifecycle exerciser; **fixture-only per locked DC-8** (operator's 3 repos already migrated in plan 1 task 11; re-running migration there is a no-op). **Opt-out documentation**: `wiki/how-to/Use-Per-Project-Install.md` (CI runners / shared dev hosts / multi-developer dotfiles cases) + `wiki/reference/Migration-Tool.md` (full flag reference + 4-state matrix + classification matrix + schema + exit codes). **Adversarial-reviewer caught 4 defects pre-commit** (all fixed): cleanup walker shape-bias destroyed operator non-`.md` files → shape-agnostic walk; `_sha256_dir` macOS `.DS_Store` noise → dotfile-component skip; force-apply rerun overwrote backup + kept stale SHA → backup_collision skip + `(rel_path, kind)` dedup; rollback file-branch missing `dest.exists()` guard → symmetric refusal across file + dir branches. **+26 unit tests** (212 total project tests). **Out of scope** (deferred): `--scope user` default-flip in installer (DC-1 lock: separate v4.5.x or v4.6.x release; smaller blast radius); removing `--scope project` mode entirely (DC-10 preservation); V4 #38 wiki bundle (first sub-item of opinionated capability bundles meta); auto-migration on first session (operator must run explicitly). **V4 #30 trio fully shipped**; next ROADMAP picks are V4 #38 (wiki bundle) or V4 #35 (documenter vault-context resolution).

- **v0.5 — 2026-05-27 — V4.5 — agentm v4.4.0 (single-repo) — Wiki I/O codification + cross-repo views (V4 #30 plan 2 of 3).** Builds on V4.4 plan 1's `repo_registry` primitive to ship the wiki I/O contract + ergonomics layer + cross-repo views. **Wiki I/O contract**: documenter sub-agent gains a "Cross-repo write contract" subsection under its existing hard-boundary write-scope (3 locked constraints — registry membership + path resolution + preview-before-write per-write); ADR 0004 gains Amendment 2026-05-27 codifying preview-before-write + per-repo `.diataxis-conventions.md` override + cross-repo target resolution via repo_registry. **`wiki-author` skill**: new operator-facing dispatcher at `harness/skills/wiki-author/SKILL.md` (v0.1.0; claude-code-only). Auto-fires on imperative wiki-write phrases (5 documented triggers + 5 documented non-triggers in the SKILL body). Resolves cwd vs cross-repo via repo_registry; loads per-repo conventions; emits unified diff preview; dispatches `documenter` for the actual write. Pure SKILL.md instructions (no Python helper); matches lightweight-skill pattern of pii-scrubber. **Cross-repo views**: `recent-wiki-changes.{sh,ps1}` script (bash + pwsh twins) walks `repo_registry.list_repos()`; per-repo wiki/ mtime walk; emits SLUG/MODE/PAGE/MODIFIED table. CLI flags: `--repo`, `--days`, `--limit`. `/recent-wiki-changes` slash command at `adapters/claude-code/commands/` (claude-code-only; check-parity extended with `CANON_UTIL_COMMANDS`). Default recent window: 7 days; configurable via `AGENTM_WIKI_RECENT_DAYS` env. **No paired crickets release** — all surfaces live in agentm post-V4 #36; crickets stays at v2.1.0; **single-repo agentm v4.4.0**. **Foundation for V4 #38 wiki bundle** (first sub-item of opinionated capability bundles meta; lands after plan 2 closes). **Deferred**: SessionStart auto-surface for cross-repo views (locked DC-2 on-demand-only); real-time wiki watcher (mtime-on-walk sufficient; ADR 0001 stdlib-only Python preserved); antigravity skill-trigger semantics for wiki-author (deferred until Antigravity skill-triggering stabilizes); plan 3 of 3 (migration tooling for non-operator users — queued next).

- **v0.4 — 2026-05-27 — V4.4 — crickets v2.1.0 + agentm v4.3.0 (paired pair #12) — Global install + `--scope user` default + auto-stay-in-sync.** ROADMAP-V4 item #30 (plan 1 of 3). The first install-model overhaul — implements the long-locked `--scope user` default + global-install pattern from this HLD's "Install scope" section + locked design call #21 (operator-stated insight 2026-05-24). `--scope user` flag added to both installers (`agentm/install.{sh,ps1}` + `crickets/install.sh`; pwsh dispatch in crickets installer deferred); when `--scope user`, install prefix = `~/.claude/` and per-project install is skipped. Three new cross-repo Python helpers at `lib/install/python/` (byte-identical between repos; sync-lib-managed): `install_state.py` (probe + persist mode JSON); `install_symlinks.py` (source-mode symlinks per locked DC-7: skill dirs + agent .md + command .md + hook bundles); `install_copy.py` (release-mode SHA256-aware copy with conservative divergence detection). Settings.json fragments + pre-push template stay as copies per DC-8. New `install-state-sync` SessionStart hook (claude-code; non-blocking): SHA256-digest-aware fragment re-merge + release-mode upstream-version-check (24h cache; never auto-applies — surface notice per DC-3). New `repo_registry.py` primitive: vault-backed registry at `<vault>/_meta/repos.json`; cross-device-portable via POSIX path normalization; reuses V4 #26 `safe_write_replace_style()`. `agentm-update` global PATH launcher (`~/.local/bin/agentm-update` + .ps1 twin) reads recorded `installer_source` + invokes `--update --scope user` with pass-through args. **crickets-sibling auto-detect** in agentm installer (FOLLOWUPS-bundled): clones + dispatches crickets if missing; `AGENTM_NO_CRICKETS_BOOTSTRAP=1` opt-out. **dev-setup mentions sweep** across both repos' public docs (FOLLOWUPS-bundled; ADR 0012 + historical entries preserved per locked exemption). **Default scope stays `project` for v4.3.0 + v2.1.0 backward compat**; flips to `user` in a future release once real-use validates. **Mid-build dogfood discoveries from plan #22 task 11** (operator-machine `--scope user` migration of agentm + sherwood + dev-setup): **(1) install_symlinks bundle-walk gap** — mapping for agentm slug missed `harness/skills/` (4 dir bundles + 2 file skills) + `harness/hooks/` (7 dir bundles); caught at real-vault smoke (~/.claude/hooks/ only had 3 of expected 10); unit tests didn't catch because fixture vaults didn't include those paths (test-coverage gap deferred). **(2-3) Windows path-handling** — `repo_registry.register_repo` used native separators via `str(Path(...))` (broke cross-device vault portability; switched to `as_posix()`); `install_symlinks._classify_existing` compared symlink targets via `Path.resolve()` which fails on Windows UNC-prefix normalization (`//?/C:/...` vs `C:/...`); switched to `os.path.samefile()`. **(4) Bash-only test failures on Windows CI** — bash launchers + bash hooks executed via Git Bash don't emit expected stderr cleanly; `TestAgentmUpdateLauncher` + `TestInstallStateSyncBashHook` marked `@unittest.skipIf(platform.system() == "Windows")`; pwsh-twin test coverage = follow-up. +78 new unit tests (108 baseline → 186 across 12 new classes). **Snapshot pattern transferred from V4 #26**: belt-and-braces `~/.claude.pre-v4-30-snapshot-<ts>` taken pre-migration (recovery never invoked but reduced operator-blast-radius risk-cost). **Deferred to v4.4.x or follow-up plans**: full `--scope user` default flip; pwsh dispatch in crickets/install.ps1; settings.json hook-registration migration to user-scope (per-repo `.harness/hooks/` references intact so safe to defer); pwsh launcher + hook test coverage; bundle-walk unit test coverage for harness/skills + harness/hooks (test-fixture gap from this plan).

- **v0.3 — 2026-05-27 — V4.3 — agentm v4.1.0 — Vault-backed harness state + folder rename.** ROADMAP-V4 item #26. The first BUILD on top of the V4.2 reorganization. Implements the locked design from this HLD's "State migration" section + plan #18's `.harness/designs/v4-device-wide/05-state-migration.md` + `06-dispatcher-contracts.md` + `08-concurrency.md` + `09-backward-compat.md`. Per-project state files (PLAN.md, progress.md, ROADMAP-*.md, FOLLOWUPS.md, features.json, init.sh, designs/, archived plans, cursor files) relocate from `<project>/.harness/` to `<vault>/projects/<slug>/_harness/`. Vault top-level folder `personal-projects/` renames to `projects/` in the same release. Backward-compat preserved: legacy `<project>/.harness/<file>` reads still work via the resolver's tier-2 fallback with a one-warn-per-session-per-file deprecation notice; writes go only to vault unless `.project-mode=local` (the operator-opt-out escape hatch). Concurrency primitives ship per the §08-concurrency design: `safe_write_replace_style()` with mtime-based concurrent-modification check; `detect_conflict_files()` for GDrive `(conflicted copy …)` files; new `conflict-merger-session-start` hook (claude-code-only, non-blocking, surfaces detections on stderr at SessionStart). Cross-repo `list-plans.{sh,ps1}` ships the "show me all in-flight plans" surface that becomes meaningful once state is centralized. Single-repo release (no paired crickets bump); crickets stays at v2.0.0. The reorg is *additive* — no breaking changes for v4.0.0 operators. Operator-paced migration: `migrate-harness-to-vault.sh <project>` per project; `--rollback` flips back; `--cleanup` removes legacy after byte-identical verification. Hard-cut deprecation of legacy paths deferred to a later v4.x release. **Dogfood discoveries from plan #20 task 9** (mid-build operator-vault migration of multiple repos): three bugs caught + fixed pre-release (preview-mode sweep gap; `_idea-incubator/` wikilinks excluded from sweep; stale `github.repo` in agentm's `project.json` from pre-v3.1.0 rename caused wrong slug resolution). Six watchlist items deferred to operator's real-use sessions (multi-device cursor concurrency stress test; mobile-readable `progress.md` formatting at 723+ lines; GDrive conflict-file naming edge cases; recall-noise from vault-resident PLAN narratives; backward-compat warning behavior in real-use; cross-repo list-plans UX iteration).

- **v0.2 — 2026-05-27 — V4.2 — crickets v2.0.0 + agentm v4.0.0 (paired pair #11) — Reorganization.** ROADMAP-V4 item #36 — the first BUILD plan after #31 (this HLD's design pass) locked the architecture. Compound skills (`memory`, `design`, `diataxis-author`, `ship-release`), the four memory hooks, the `evidence-tracker` hook, the `memory-idea-researcher` sub-agent, the `plugins/` tree (with `install-plugin.sh`), and the `bundles/` namespace (with `quality-gates`) all moved from crickets to Agent M. The split now reflects the device-wide-by-default rationale: crickets owns universal base primitives; Agent M owns the agentic memory + compound flows that turn the harness into a learning environment. crickets v2.0.0 narrows to base primitives only (2 skills + 3 sub-agents + 3 hooks); Agent M v4.0.0 absorbs the compound surface + memory stack and dispatches it via a new manifest-walking installer block. The reorg deliberately does NOT ship state migration (the `<vault>/projects/<slug>/_harness/` move) — that's V4 #26, next on the queue. v4.0.0 keeps the legacy `<project>/.harness/` paths intact with deprecation warning until #26 lands. No vault-side migration required; operators run `agentm/install.sh` after `crickets/install.sh` and the compound skills + memory hooks land at the same `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/hooks/`, `.agents/skills/` destinations crickets v1.x used.

- **v0.1 — 2026-05-26**: initial publication, paired with plan #18 close.

Future updates land here as the V4 build phases (#26, #30, #35, #32) ship + as V6/V7 work touches the architecture. A heavy operator-edit + reflection pass on the broader Agent Memory HLD set is scheduled for post-V6 close.
